# Bergmann

This is a game about blocks and mining. Some people may claim, it's a a clone of minecraft.

Bergmann is the German word for miner.

## Technology

This is built entirely with .NET 6.0 and OpenGL (the wrapper is [OpenTK](https://opentk.net/), a very nice wrapper for OpenGL). The server is built with SignalR.

## TODO
Quite a lot. Here's a short list.

- Fancy lightning
- Server/client interaction
- Game logic (everything)
